# IQAC Mailer Application

## Problem Statement
The decentralized nature of email communication within educational institutions leads to several challenges, including:

- **Inconsistent messaging:** Different departments and administrative units send emails independently, leading to duplication of information and inconsistent messaging.
- **Schedule conflicts:** Students and faculty receive multiple emails with overlapping schedules and events, leading to confusion and missed opportunities.
- **Fragmented communication:** Important announcements and updates get lost in the volume of emails, making it difficult for recipients to stay informed and engaged.
- **Administrative burden:** Managing email distribution lists, resolving conflicts, and ensuring timely delivery of critical information imposes a significant administrative burden on staff and faculty.

## Project Flow

### Purpose
The primary objective of this portal is to streamline email communication within educational institutions using a dedicated IQAC Mailer Application. By automating the process of sending emails, the portal ensures efficient dissemination of information.
